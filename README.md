# Terrain-Identification-from-Time-Series-Data

## Type: Academic Group Project

## Project Description
NCSU ECE 542 (Neural Networks and Deep Learning) Competition Project
  - Implement LSTM model to predict types of terrain based on timer-series data collected from sensors in Pytorch

## Dependencies
  - numpy
  - torch
  - re
  - pandas
  - glob
  - diamondback
  - sklearn
  - typing
  - os
  - random
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - collection
  - Anaconda on Windows 10 Education -> Jupyter Notebook
  
## About the Repo.
  - This repository has a Jupyter notebook that contains the code for the entire project and decision matrices for training/validation.  The general approach is to preprocess data, feed preprocessed data into an LSTM model (3 layers), and postprocess the prediction data.  LSTM is chosen due to its ability to work well with time-series data
